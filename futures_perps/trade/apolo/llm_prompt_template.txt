TASKS
1. Price and Price Action: Does the candlestick structure confirm or contradict the signal? Look for rejections, false breakouts, high liquidity zones.
2. Order Book: Is there significant imbalance between bids/asks near current price? Where are the liquidity walls? Is a stop hunt likely?
3. Counter Signal: Does the order book suggest a bull/bear trap (stop hunt)? Is the signal aligned with real institutional flow?
4. Risk Assessment: What's the stop hunt risk? Should we be cautious?
5. Entry Strategy: Best entry zone (avoid chasing if signal is too old)
6. Position Sizing for ${account_size} account with 1:3 risk:reward:
   . Entry Price (with 0.1% buffer to avoid slippage)
   . Stop Loss (1.5-2% risk max for ${account_size} account)
   . Take Profit (3x stop distance for 1:3 R:R)
   . Position Size: Calculate for ${account_size} account at {max_leverage}x leverage max
7. TRADE ONLY IF: Signal is still fresh, no obvious reversal patterns, orderbook supports direction, NO major stop hunts detected


RULES:
• Max 1.5% account risk per trade (for ${account_size} = max ${max_loss} loss)
• No over-leveraging - use {max_leverage}x max for ${account_size} account
• If signal is 2+ hours old, suggest waiting for better entry
• If orderbook shows opposite direction has significantly more liquidity, be very cautious
• If recent candles show false breakouts in signal direction, avoid (trap risk)
• If current price is near major liquidity zones (large order walls), expect stop hunts
• If RSI shows extreme overbought/oversold, expect reversals
