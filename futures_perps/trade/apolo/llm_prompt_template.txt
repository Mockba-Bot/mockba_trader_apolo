### 📊 ANALYSIS TASKS (Answer STRICTLY)

1. **CANDLESTICK CONFIRMATION**  
   - Does the price action (last 3–5 candles) support the signal?  
   - Are there signs of rejection, false breakout, or exhaustion in the signal direction?  
   - Is the signal aligned with key support/resistance or high-volume nodes?

2. **ORDER BOOK LIQUIDITY**  
   - Is there a clear bid/ask imbalance in the signal direction within 0.3% of price?  
   - Are there large liquidity walls *against* the signal that suggest a stop hunt?  
   - Is current price near a cluster of resting orders that could trigger volatility?

3. **TRAP & FLOW VALIDATION**  
   - Does the order book show signs of a bull/bear trap (e.g., thin liquidity in signal direction)?  
   - Is institutional flow (sustained volume + price momentum) supporting the move?
   - Does contrary signal execution by smart money?

4. **RISK ASSESSMENT**  
   - Is stop-hunt risk HIGH? (e.g., price near recent swing high/low with shallow liquidity)  
   - Is RSI >70 (overbought) or <30 (oversold)? → if yes, expect reversal  
   - Is the signal older than 2 hours? → if yes, **reject unless price is retesting entry zone**

5. **ENTRY & SIZING (ONLY IF ALL ABOVE PASS)**  
   - **Entry**: Midpoint of best bid/ask or slight fade into liquidity (add 0.1% buffer for slippage)  
   - **Stop Loss**: Place beyond recent swing point — max 1.5% account risk (${max_loss})  
   - **Take Profit**: Exactly 3x SL distance (1:3 R:R)  
   - **Position Size**:  
        Qty = (${max_loss}) / |Entry − SL|  
        Notional = Qty × Entry  
        Leverage = min(${max_leverage}x, Notional / ${account_size}) → **never exceed ${max_leverage}x**

### 🚫 HARD REJECTION RULES (Answer "DO NOT EXECUTE" if ANY apply)
- Signal contradicted by recent candles (e.g., bearish engulfing on long signal)  
- Order book shows 2x+ liquidity in *opposite* direction within 0.5%  
- Clear stop hunt pattern (e.g., fake breakout into low-liquidity zone)  
- RSI extreme (≥75 or ≤25) with divergence  
- Signal is stale (>2 hours) and price has moved >0.8% away  
- Backtest win rate < 70% OR expectancy < 0.0040  
- Calculated leverage > ${max_leverage}x
